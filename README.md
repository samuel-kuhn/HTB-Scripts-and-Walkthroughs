# HTB-Scripts
Scripts that hack parts of or entire HTB Machines.

These are scripts that I wrote after hacking a HTB machine.
They give you a reverse shell or a flag of a machine without the user having to enter the commands manually.

I wrote them mainly for myself to get a better understanding of the machines and python/bash scripts.
