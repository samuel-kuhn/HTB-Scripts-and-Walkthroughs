# HTB-Scripts
Scripts to Hack HTB Machines
----------------------------

This repository contains scripts I've created for hacking HTB (Hack The Box) machines. They automate tasks like obtaining a reverse shell or retrieving flags, saving you from typing commands manually. I made these scripts mainly for my own learning, to better understand HTB machines and practice Python and Bash scripting.
