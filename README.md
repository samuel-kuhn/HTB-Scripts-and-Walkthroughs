# HTB-Scripts
Scripts to Hack HTB Machines
----------------------------

This repository contains scripts and Walkthroughs I've created for hacking HTB (Hack The Box) machines. They automate tasks like obtaining a reverse shell or retrieving flags or they explain the steps I made to get to the flag. I made these scripts mainly for my own learning, to better understand HTB machines and practice Python and Bash scripting.
